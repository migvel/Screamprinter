Specific software for an interactive installation.

- cylmodeler.py, process the 3d models in Blender, communicates with the soundserver.py and calls external applications like skeinforge and printrun(pronsole)
- soundserver.py, server that records the sounds and sends back to the client. Also sends Gcode commands to the printer extension hardware(realy board). And listed the input(User buttom).

You need to copy .pronsolerc file into you home directory, this one, is loaded when is called printrun and executes python code(in that file). Basically controls the realy board, saves a copy of files, converts to gcode and sends the gcode file to the printer.(check the paths directory)
